Tenderly CLI is a suite of development tools for smart contracts which allow you to monitor and track their execution.

```
tenderly version
```

To upgrade it via Homebrew:

brew upgrade tenderly
```

## Usage

### Proxy Debugging

The proxy server is currently made to work with the [Truffle framework](https://truffleframework.com/) and requires the proxy to be run from the root of your Smart Contract project where the Truffle configuration is located.

```
// Example using Ganache defaults
tenderly proxy --target-port 7545
```

In your Truffle configuration configure your local network config to point to the running proxy or create a new network for proxy debugging.

```
module.exports = {
    networks: {
        //...
        proxy: {
            host: "127.0.0.1",
            port: 9545,
            network_id: "*",
            gasPrice: 0
        },
        ganache: {
            host: "127.0.0.1",
            port: 7545,
            network_id: "*",
            gasPrice: 0
        },
        //...
    }
};
```

After setting up the network you can now call your Truffle commands just as before by changing the `--network` to the appropriate one.

```
$user > truffle exec ./scripts/test-scripts.js --network proxy
Using network 'proxy'.


Error: 0x0 Error: REVERT, execution stopped
	at require(square == original)
		in FailContract:5

...
```

Now when your transactions fail you can see the exact line of code in which the error occurred and the whole stacktrace by using our proxy command.
