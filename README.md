```

#### Command Flags

| Flag | Default | Description                                                            |
| --- | --- |------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| --authentication-method | / | Pick the authentication method. Possible values are email or access-key |
| --email | / | The email used when authentication method is email                     |
| --password | / | The password used when authentication method is email                  |
| --access-key | / | The token used when authentication method is access-key         |
| --force | false | Don't check if you are already logged in                               |
| --help | / | Help for login command                                                 |

### Init

The `init` command is used to connect your local project directory with a project in the [Tenderly Dashboard](https://dashboard.tenderly.co).

```
tenderly init
```

#### Command Flags

| Flag | Default | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| --project | / | The project name used for generating the configuration file |
| --create-project | false | Creates the project provided by the --project flag if it doesn't exist |
| --re-init | false | Force initializes the project if it was already initialized |
| --help | / | Help for init command |

### Push

The `push` command is used to add your contracts to the [Tenderly Dashboard](https://dashboard.tenderly.co).

Note that the `push` command is used **only** for adding contracts that are deploy to a public network. For local networks see
the [export command](#export).

```
tenderly push
```

#### Command Flags

| Flag | Default | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| --networks | / | A comma separated list of network ids to push |
| --tag | / | Optional tag used for filtering and referencing pushed contracts |
| --project-slug | / | Optional project slug used to pick only one project to push (see advanced usage) |
| --help | / | Help for push command |

#### Advanced usage

It is possible to push to multiple projects by editing the `tenderly.yaml` file and providing a map of projects and their networks. To do this remove the already provided `project_slug` property and replace it with the `projects` property like the example below;

```yaml
projects: # running tenderly push will push the smart contracts to all of the provided projects
  my-cool-project:
    networks:
    - "1" # mainnet
    - "42" # kovan
  my-other-project:
    # if the networks property is not provided or is empty the project will be pushed to all of the migrated networks
  company-account/my-other-project:
    # if you want to push to a shared project provide the full project identifier
    # the identifier can be found in you Tenderly dashboard under the projects name
```

### Export init

In order to use the [tenderly export](#export) command you need to define a configuration file
(which is described in more detail in the [export command](#export) advanced usage section).

```
tenderly export init
```

#### Command Flags
